    <div id="Red">Red period - Webs Design</div><button id="toggler">Red!</button>
          <p>One of my favourite, most challenging, and interesting class that I have this school year.
          Taught by Mr. <a href="http://logoscambodia.github.io/webdesign2016/MrBurcham/index.html">Burcham</a>,
          I definitely have to agree with him, on the fact that the future will include a lot of software work and understanding.
        </p>
		<div id="Orange">Orange - Creative Writing</div><button id="toggler">Orange!</button>
          <p>Again, one of my favourite, most challenging, and interesting class I have this year.
            I really enjoy the class in general since it really allows me to explore myself.
            Yet, of course, there are those times where the only place I'd like to explore is dream world.
          </p>
		<div id="Yellow">Yellow - Study Hall</div><button id="toggler">Yellow!</button>
          <p> Gotta say, this is my favourite study hall out of the two that I have this Junior year.
            This is just because my girls Elizabeth Chan, Karen Sahputra,
            <a href="">Chesna Gamble</a> and I, spend our time in the cafeteria singing whilst we do homework together.
          </p>
    <div id="Green">Green - Consumer Math</div><button id="toggler">Green!</button>
          <p> As you can guess, mathmatically wise, I'm not exactly the sharpest tool in the box.
            No shame though, despite not being the stereotypical asian, I have absolutely no shame to say I'm horrible at math.
            Though I do pretty well in consumer math, especially since I grew up observing my family businesses, the longest one being Camko City.
          </p>
    <div id="Blue">Blue - World Literature</div><button id="toggler">Blue!</button>
          <p> World Literature, what can I say? A very intersting class indeed.
            The smallest mistakes means R.I.P. <br> Just really challenging.
          </p>
    <div id="indigo">Indigo - Biology </div><button id="toggler">Indigo!</button>
          <p> Biology, interesting class. Things always seem to be either hot or cold in that class; there seems to be no inbetweens.
            My friends are not exactly fond of the class, accrediting their failures to the teacher's style of teaching and speech.
            I can't say much, though personally I could understand the lessons being taught; then again I do speak the Singaporean version of the British english.
            So knowing and understanding both versions of English really helps in the class.
          </p>
    <div id="violet">Violet - Study Hall</div><button id="toggler">Violet!</button>
          <p> Study Hall! This study hall really depends on what day it is on, if it's on a friday, right after lunch during 4th period then it's fun.
            Most fridays, students in this study hall go to the multipurpose room and play the instruments.
          </p>
    <div id="afterschool">Afterschool - Yearbook</div><button id="toggler">Afterschool!</button>
          <p>Despite being completely worn out thoroughout the day, I find yearbook a bit stressful but relaxing depending on who I'm sitting next to.
            Ideas for the yearbook constantly come to me as I work during that period, though sometimes it gets confusing as to how I'll excecute it.
            At the moment, I'm part of two teams in yearbook; business and design team. Simply because I enjoy both, and both teams need me for different reasons.
